# Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

# Examples input/output:

# XO("ooxx") => true
# XO("xooxx") => false
# XO("ooxXm") => true
# XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
# XO("zzoo") => false

# In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

# The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

# Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

# You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

# The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

# Examples:
# s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
# printer_error(s) => "0/14"

# s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
# printer_error(s) => "8/22"

def printer_error(s):
    list=["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m"]
    count=0
    for alphebet in s:
        if alphebet not in list:
            count+=1
    return f"{count}/{len(s)}"
    
    
# Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

# Examples:
# a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
# b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
# longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

# a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

def longest(a1, a2):
    # your code
    a=a1+a2
    result=""
    
    for i in a:
        if i not in result:
            result+=i
            
    return ''.join(sorted(result))



# DESCRIPTION:
# In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

# Example
# filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
# filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
# filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]


def filter_list(l):
    new_list =[]
    for x in l:
        if type(x) != str:
            new_list.append(x)
    return new_list
    
# Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

# There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

# Examples
# [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
# [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

def find_it(seq):
    for a in seq:
        if seq.count(a)%2==1:
            return a

# Given a list and a number, create a new list that contains each number of list at most N times, without reordering.
# For example if the input number is 2, and the input list is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].
# With list [20,37,20,21] and number 1, the result would be [20,37,21].


def delete_nth(order,max):
    result=[]
    for a in order:
        if result.count(a)<max:
            result.append(a)
            continue
    return result


# Rules
#  1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.

#  2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat
# Example
# wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]
def wave(people):
    return[people[:i] + people[i].upper() + people[i+1:]for i in range(len(people)) if people[i]!=" "]
